Project Title
Puppy's Adult Weight Calculator

#Introduction
This Python project is a simple command-line program that allows a user to input their puppy's name, weight in pounds, and age in weeks to calculate their expected adult weight. The program uses a basic formula to calculate the adult weight and outputs a message indicating the size category of the dog based on their adult weight.

#How to Use
Clone the project repository from Github
Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory
Run the program by executing the command: python puppy_weight_calculator.py
Enter your puppy's name when prompted
Enter your puppy's weight in pounds when prompted. The program will handle invalid input by asking for a valid weight.
Enter your puppy's age in weeks when prompted. The program will handle invalid input by asking for a valid age.
The program will output the expected adult weight and size category based on the following size chart:
Adult Weight	Size Category
<=12 lbs	x-small
<=20 lbs	small
<=49 lbs	medium
<=100 lbs	large
>100 lbs	giant
